Bertrem paused before the door to gather courage. He was a young man, though his head was already bald from his nervous habit of running his fingers through his hair when studying. The Aesthetic's robes he wore were neat and clean, if somewhat faded and worn. He had been studying in the Great Library of Palanthas for over three years now, and the endless hours spent bent over ancient tomes had taken their toll on his young body.

As he stood there, he could hear voices from within the chamber - voices he recognized. One was the voice of his master, Astinus, the historian. The other was a voice that made Bertrem's blood run cold with fear. He had never heard that voice before, yet somehow he knew whose it was. It was a voice from legend, a voice that had not been heard in these halls for two years.
